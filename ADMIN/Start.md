# Introduction 
<br>
#### Version 1.1: Updated 15th February 2025
v1.0: Initial version
<br>
v1.1: Added information in step 1 about MDC builder and how to use CombatFlite with Kola.

<br>
If this is your first mission in OPAC you should start reading in the order listed below.
Operation Arctic Citadel is a comprehensive campaign that will span over 30+ events. 
Because of this, there is a large background and supporting documents to setup the campaign.
In addition this campaign is unique because of volunteers filling the roles as the intelligence agency, Virtual Intelligence Service (VIS)
and volunteers in the role as Joint Force Air Component Command directing and commanding the Air Campaign. These roles do not have access to the .miz file
and is highly relient on pilot reporting during and after events.
All information can be found from the frontpage: [OPAC Frontpage](https://132nd-vwing.github.io/OPAC-Brief/)
<br>
<br>

#### Step 1: Multiplayer instructions / Data Card Builder
Start by reading the 132nd Multiplayer instructions to get access to server connection details for both DCS and SRS. The multiplayer instructions also 
gives instruction on how to sign-up on the website under events.
- [132nd Multiplayer instructions](https://cloud.132virtualwing.org/s/NDtZWdGmmwoe4ei)
<br>
In addition, it is recommended to use the 132nd Mission Data Card Builder for creating MDCs. The MDC builder have mission data built in. The best way to use the MDC builder 
is to create the flight plan in CombatFlite, and then import the file in MDC builder and follow the steps to generate the kneeboard. The kneeboard can be shared and also
export a .json file that can be used in DCS DTC(make sure to select PDF during download).

<br>
<br>

#### Step 2: Road to war and admin
After the general multiplayer informaion for 132nd events you should read the road to war orientation. This gives a big picture understanding of the campaign, and also provide
some administrative information about the campaign construct. For any questions to the campaign constructs and the admin, please ask Neck as the campaign host.
- [Road to war (Scenario)](/OPAC-Brief/SITUATION/132nd OP ARCTIC CITADEL Introduction Brief.pdf) 
<br>
<br>

#### Step 3: Combined Joint Task Force 23 Operations Order
Next you should read the operations order for CJTF-23 (which we all are a part of). This order gives the overall guidance to the entire force
(both ground, air and sea). This operation order is governing the entire campaign.
- [CJTF 23 OP ORDER](/OPAC-Brief/ORDERS/JFC/OPAC_CJTF23_OPERATION ORDER.pdf)
<br>
<br>

#### Step 4: Intelligence
Next you should read various intelligene products to get a more detailed understanding of the enemy, and the situation. Here you can do a deep dive, or you can skim the surface.
This step is something you should review before every event where you attend. Before each mission VIS will publish Intelligence Summarys (INTSUM) from the previous event.
INTSUMs contain relevant intelligence from the last event plus assessment for future events. (NOTE: VIS only get what pilots are reporting, so make sure to support VIS
by providing a accurate report after mission completion).
In addition to the VIS INTSUMs there is several other Intelligence Reports (INTREP) that cover certain topics. 
- [Intelligence](/OPAC-Brief/INTELLIGENCE/Intelligence.html)
<br>
<br>

#### Step 5: Joint Air Operations Plan (JAOP)
Next you should read the JAOP. This is the Joint Force Air Component Commands (JFACC) plan for how the air component (which we all are a part of) should execute 
the entire air campaign to solve the mission given in the CJTF-23 OP ORDER. This document is made fully by the volunteers (JFACC) based on availeble intelligence and guidance from 
CJTF-23.
- [Joint Air Operations Plan (JAOP) TO BE ISSUED BY JFACC PRIOR TO D1](/OPAR-Brief/ORDERS/JFACC/TBIBYJFACC.pdf)
<br>
<br>

#### Step 6: Special Instructions (SPINS)
Next you should read the SPINS. This is a single document that governs air operations for the entire force. This document contains various information, such as command and control, 
risk levels, A-A information, tanker information etc.
- [SPINS ](/OPAC-Brief/MISSION INFORMATION/OPAC STANDING SPINS.pdf)
<br>
<br>

#### Step 7: Air Operations Directive (AOD)
When you are getting close to a event (an event is published on the 132nd event page). You should start looking for the Air Operations Directive (AOD) provided by JFACC.
Before each ATO day or phase JFACC will publish a Air Operations Directive (AOD). The AOD will be linked on the event page. 
The AOD contains the JFACCs direction and guidance to all forces participating in the event. 
The Air Tasking Order (ATO) is created based on the AOD.
These documents will be availeble on the main page for OPAR.
<br>
<br>

#### Step 8: Air Tasking Order and Joint Prioritized Target List (JPTL)  
When signed up, and assigned to a flight you are now ready to start your detailed flight planning. You should now find your mission on the ATO (on the 132nd website). 
The ATO is availeble normally late friday evenings before a event on sundays. 
The ATO gives the necessary details required for your flight planning.
The JPTL contains the targets that the air component is tasked to attack on this specific event.
Additional information is availeble on the OPAR briefing main page, under mission information.
<br>
<br>

#### Step 9: Fly your mission
Execute your mission
<br>
<br>

#### Step 10: After Action Review (AAR)
After you have flown and conducted the debrief the next step  is to fill out a AAR on the 132nd website. 
The focus for the AAR is on giving everyone a common understanding on what happened in the mission, 
and share valuable learning points and recommendations that can improve tactics and execution in later missions.
<br>
The after action report contains the following important information, and is filled out on the 132nd website:
-	Event sequence:What was done in the mission. Where was it flown.
-	Lessons Learned: What experiences was done in the mission. What worked, what did not work. Suggestions of tactics that may work, or other ideas on how to solve t he mission or handling situations.
-	Battle Damage Assessment (BDA): Not needed in AAR. This will be filled in on a dedicated tool for reporting intelligence, see Step 11
-	Intel:  Not needed in AAR. This will be filled in on a dedicated tool for reporting intelligence, see Step 11
-	Attachements: Any pictures (TGP / HUD / out of cockpit) are to be posted in the #bda-reports channel on the 132nd Discord server or as a link in the AAR.
<br>
<br>

#### Step 11: Submit intelligence and BDA
All intelligence, BDA or relevant information are reported in Campaign Manager. This ensures that all information is available in a database that are exportable,
which make the workflow for VIS volunteers much easier. 
- To report intelligence go to this website: [Campaign Manager](https://cm.132virtualwing.org/campaigns)
- Follow the steps in the picture below:

![How to report intelligence](/ADMIN/Report Intelligence instruction.png)

This is the information that VIS uses to produce intelligence for upcoming missions, and JFACC uses as support to make decisions and provide direction and guidance.
All locations should be given in the following format DD MM.MMM  DDD MM.MMM. This makes the job for VIS much easier, as they can just paste the coordinates into CombatFlite.
If you only have bulls information, we kindly request you to use 1-2 minutes to convert it into correct coordinates before posting your report.

### Get OPAC access
Once you have completed Step 1-3 and understood the rest of the steps, send Neck a PM on discord and ask to be given the OPAC role on discord giving you all the necessary access to 
participate in the campaign.
